Citibike user analysis

Analyzed Citibike user and ridership data over March 2020 through March 2021. Created visualizations on Tableau that aimed to answer the following questions:-

* Number of total trips recorded during the chosen period
* Percent share of total ridership growth
* Change in proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers
* Peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months
* Peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months
* The top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey and why
* The top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey and why
* The bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey and why
* The bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey and why
* Gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)
* Effectiveness of gender outreach programs in increasing female ridership over the timespan
* Change in the average trip duration by age
* Average distance in miles that a bike is ridden
* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan
* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

The visualizations are also compiled as a Tableau dashboard and story. Further depicted a map that indicates the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top. Insights from the data have been summarized in the uploaded Key Insights document.
