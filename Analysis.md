## Key Insights

* Citibike data has been analyzed for March 2020 and March 2021

* Overall Citibike ridership decreased by approx 5% over 2020-21, likely due to a decrease in trips as work from home ensued during the pandemic

* This was also evident in the decrease in total trip duration, which fell by approx 3% over the same period

* In 2021, number of short term customers with a 24-hour or 3-day pass increased, while long term, annual subscribers declined. This could be due to regular members stopping their annual subscription due to a decline in number of trips

* In Mar 2020, peak hours coincided with office hours, at around 8:25AM and 5:45PM. This changed in Mar 2021, as work from home continued; the peak appeared at 10:10PM. This could also be an anomaly in data.

* Males were the largest users of Citibike in March 2020. However, large proportion of 'Unknown' gender indicates that most users did not disclose their gender in 2021.
    * It maybe difficult to assess if gender outreach programs were effective in increasing female ridership as it appears that most of the short-term customers in 2021 did not disclose their gender
    * On a similar vein, there is a significant fall of 88.7% in female ridership over March 2020-21. However this number could be skewed as there were a large number of 'Unknown' in 2021

* In 2020, majority of the users were in the 26-45 age group, with males comprising 74.5% of the group. In 2021, users within the 46-65 age group jumped up

* In 2020, the 46-65 age group appeared to go on longer rides lasting 45-50 mins on avg, while younger age group (26-45) took shorter trip of 13 mins on avg. In 2021, all age groups took trips lasting 20 mins on avg
    * Longer trips by an older age group (46-65) could be attributable to greater health consciousness, as compared to a younger age group
